        <h3>Steps/Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br/><br/></li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add chicken
                    breasts; reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart easily with a fork
                    and is no longer pink, 10-15 minutes. Drain water, shred chicken with 2 forks,
                    and set aside.
                <br/><br/></li>
                <li>While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                     Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet
                     firm to the bite, about 8 minutes, Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer
                     on a paper towel to dry.
                <br/><br/></li>
                <li>Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion
                    and garlic in the hot butter just until onion is translucent, 5-7 minutes.
                <br/><br/></li>
                <li>Mixed shredded chick, onion-garlic mixture, 1 cup spaghetti sauce, ricotta
                    cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl.
                <br/><br/></li>
                <li>Mix remaining spaghetti sauce and remaining Parmesan cheese together in another bowl.
                    Spread a thin layer on the bottom of a glass 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles,
                    spread chicken mixture on top, then add another thin layer of the sauce mixture. Repeat,
                    leaving a final layer of noodles on top. Top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella
                    and Cheddar cheese on top.
                <br/><br/></li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese bubbles, about 45 minutes.
